## CREDITS
* [Jess Frazelle](https://github.com/jfrazelle) for [containers on the deskop](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/).

## WHAT DOES THIS DO?
This is a container that runs PyCharm.

## HOW TO RUN IT?
0. Make sure you're on a system running [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).
1. Disable X access control (don't do this on a public-facing machine): `$ xhost +`
2. `$ cd` to a path where you want to write some code.
3. ``docker run --rm -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY hackenfreude/pycharm``
4. You should see the PyCharm splash screen and eventually PyCharm.
5. Have fun. Write some code. Close PyCharm when you're done, and the container will shut down. Your files will be in the path on the host where you started.
6. __Reenable X access control:__ `$ xhost -`

## WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
* Docker mounted the host's X socket in the continer as the container's X socket; this allows the container's GUI to pass back up to the host.
* Docker mounted the host's working directory in the container at the same path.

## WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?
Open an [issue](https://github.com/hackenfreude/docker-pycharm/issues/new).
